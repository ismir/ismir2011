<!--<h4>Special Paper Category</h4>
<p>ISMIR 2011 is soliciting a special category of papers: State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs).

Only a few STAR papers will be selected. A STAR paper will be presented in an oral presentation.</p>

<!--
<h4>Music Submissions</h4>
<p>We are pleased to offer a special category of submissions this year to ISMIR involving music compositions that rely on tools and research germane to the MIR community. We encourage submissions of new music made possible through techniques from the music information retrieval community and/or sonification of large data setsy.</p>
<p>Music submissions are treated like paper submissions and should be entered using the link provided at <a href="ismir2011.ismir.net">ismir2011.ismir.net</a>. Note that all submissions are blind in nature; please remove all identifying information from audio files, scores, and abstracts. Please select the “Music” category when submitting for programming consideration during these special concerts. Music submissions should include a maximum two-page description of the work submitted, including a 150&#8211;200 word abstract as well as a PDF file containing the score (if applicable). Links to online audio excerpts or other multimedia material and detailing any special requirements for the presentation should be specified on the web submission form. Acceptance is based on the recommendation of the music selection committee, the work’s relevance to MIR, availability of performers (if applicable), and production quality (if applicable). If your submitted work involves live performer(s), please indicate your ability to provide them for performance at the concert.</p>
-->
<h4>Tutorial proposals</h4>
<p>The first day of the conference (October 24) will consist of parallel sessions of half-day tutorials each concentrating on a single topic and lasting about 3 hours, including a break. The tutorials are presented either at an introductory level or in depth and are intended to provide an informative and stimulating coverage of current topics in MIR and beyond. Tutorial proposals should consist of a 1&#8211;4 page abstract including the following:</p>
<ul>

<p>Acceptance/rejection decisions will be made by the ISMIR 2011 Conference Committee and will be notified by April 30. The decision will depend on criteria including relevance, suitability, originality, and expertise of the presenter(s).</p>

<h4>Late-Breaking and Demo Submissions</h4>
<p>A special session during ISMIR 2011 will be dedicated to the presentation of late-breaking research results and demonstration of applications that are of interest to the MIR community. Abstracts will be published online, but will not have an associated paper published in the conference proceedings. Accepted work will be designated as poster-only presentations, with the option to present a demonstration at the poster session.</p>
<p>Late-breaking / demo submissions will be reviewed on extended abstracts of one page (preferred) or two pages (maximum). If there is a demonstration component, the submission must make this clear, the abstract must contain a section containing a brief explanation of what the demonstration will do and what the presentation requirements are. Abstract formatting must comply to the guidelines and templates for regular papers available at the ISMIR 2011 <a href="submission.html">submission guidelines page.</a></p>
<p><b>*NOTE</b>: Late-breaking/demo submissions do NOT need to be made anonymous.<b>*</b></p>
<p>Submissions should made by Monday, September 5, 2011 on the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/c/ismir2011-lbd/">late-breaking demos submission page.</a> Should there be more submissions than allowed by the available presentation space, presentations that contribute to a balanced session will be given priority.</p>

<h4>Exhibits and Bookstore</h4>
<p>Throughout ISMIR 2011, space will be available for publishers, software companies, booksellers, service providers, system vendors, and any other businesses interested in exhibiting their MIRrelated products.
