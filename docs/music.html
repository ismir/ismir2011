<!--
<p>This page provides information for authors for submitting papers to ISMIR 2011.</p>
-->

<h4>Music Submissions</h4>
<p>We are pleased to offer a special category of submissions this year to ISMIR involving music compositions that rely on tools and research germane to the MIR community. We encourage submissions of new music made possible through techniques from the music information retrieval community and/or sonification of large data setsy.</p>
<p>Music submissions are treated like paper submissions and should be entered using the link provided at ismir2011.ismir.net. Note that all submissions are blind in nature; please remove all identifying information from audio files, scores, and abstracts. Please select the “Music” category when submitting for programming consideration during these special concerts. Music submissions should include a maximum two-page description of the work submitted, including a 150&#8211;200 word abstract as well as a PDF file containing the score (if applicable). Links to online audio excerpts or other multimedia material and detailing any special requirements for the presentation should be specified on the web submission form. Acceptance is based on the recommendation of the music selection committee, the work’s relevance to MIR, availability of performers (if applicable), and production quality (if applicable). If your submitted work involves live performer(s), please indicate your ability to provide them for performance at the concert.</p>


<h4>Where to Submit</h4>
<p>Music submissions: <a href="https://www.softconf.com/c/ismir2011music/" target="_blank">https://www.softconf.com/c/ismir2011music/</a></p>
<!--<p>The templates also include all the information about formatting manuscripts for ISMIR 2010. For preparing your paper, LaTeX is strongly recommended to give the final proceedings a uniform look.</p>

<h4>Double Blind Review Policy</h4>
<p>To promote fair and objective assessment of each paper, double-blind review will be adopted.  Authors should omit their identifiers in the submission as much as possible. Please omit authors’ names from title page (or list as “name(s) omitted for submission”), and avoid revealing their identities through citation. For example, the references to previous work by the third person would be preferable: “we extend Smith’s (2007) earlier work” rather than “we extend our earlier work.” Citations to author’s own work that are not fundamental to understanding the paper should be excluded. These citations can be added in the camera-ready copy.</p>

<p>We encourage authors to anonymize their submissions in order to follow a double-blind review process. We, however, realize that in certain circumstances this might not be possible due to factors such as reporting results on well known established systems or providing web links to multimedia material such as sounds and videos. In such cases where the reviewing of the paper might be hindered by the double-review policy, authors can decide to reveal their identities.</p>
