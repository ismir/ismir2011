				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
This statement informs you how Florida International University will 
collect and process your personal data when you access this web site <ismir2011.ismir.net>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>As it is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information 
automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes 
internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service 
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp,

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to 
analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around
 the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
 whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally 
identifiable information.

<p>Where you are required under this website to provide personal data 
(such as when filling out forms) this data will be used for the 
following purposes: to confirm registrations, to provide you with 
information about our conferences and our services, to provide you with 
information about ISMIR, to contact you when necessary.
Please note that Florida International University is a public university

more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL"><span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL</span></a>
 
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we 
receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or 
method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore while we strive
 to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal 
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
